    <string name="psalms">Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High
    will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.[a]
2
I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress,
    my God, in whom I trust.”

3
Surely he will save you
    from the fowler’s snare
    and from the deadly pestilence.
4
He will cover you with his feathers,
    and under his wings you will find refuge;
    his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.”</string>
